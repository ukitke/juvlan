### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla or lightweight framework)
- **Responsive Framework**: CSS Grid/Flexbox for mobile-first design
- **Chat Processing**: Client-side JavaScript for privacy
- **Data Storage**: LocalStorage for session data, no backend required
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel)

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Chat Analyzer Component

**Purpose**: Parse WhatsApp export files and extract Serie A-related content with personality-aware analysis

**Key Functions**:
- `parseWhatsAppExport(fileContent)`: Parse exported chat text
- `identifyPersonalities(messages)`: Map users to their allegiances and personalities
- `extractControversialStatements(messages)`: Find outrageous claims and predictions
- `identifyRefereeDebates(messages)`: Extract VAR/referee controversy discussions
- `findPlayerDebates(messages)`: Locate heated player comparison arguments
- `extractInsideJokes(messages)`: Identify recurring nicknames and group references
- `generatePersonalizedQuestions(analyzedContent)`: Create targeted quiz questions

**Personality Mapping**:
```javascript
{
  "Briks": { 
    team: "Milan", 
    nickname: "Pagliaccio Strategico",
    traits: ["defensive", "analytical", "sarcastic"],
    targets: ["Leão defender", "Inter bias critic"]
  },
  "Dionis": {
    team: "Inter",
    nickname: "Ronaldios",
    traits: ["hyperbolic", "predictive", "passionate"],
    targets: ["wrong predictions", "Dimarco worship"]
  },
  "Sem Il Lungo": {
    team: "Juve", 
    traits: ["conspiracy theorist", "anti-Inter"],
    targets: ["Marotta League accusations"]
  }
  // ... other personalities
}
```

**Content Pattern Recognition**:
- Prediction patterns: "Inter will win 3-0", "Milan beats Real then loses to Cagliari"
- Controversy triggers: VAR decisions, referee calls, penalty incidents
- Player criticism patterns: Effort complaints, performance comparisons
- Banter escalation: Emoji usage (🤡), nickname deployment, group dynamics

**Input Format**: WhatsApp export (.txt file)
```
[DD/MM/YY, HH:MM:SS] Contact Name: Message content
```

**Output**: Rich question objects with personality context and banter metadata

### 2. Question Bank Component

**Purpose**: Manage and serve quiz questions from multiple sources

**Question Types**:
- **Prediction Fails**: Incorrect predictions with specific quotes (e.g., Dionis predicting 4-0 Atalanta vs Milan)

- **Referee Conspiracy**: "Marotta League" incidents and VAR controversies
- **Player Debates**: Heated arguments (Leão criticism, Lautaro vs Vlahovic, Theo vs Dimarco)
- **Inside Jokes**: Nicknames and group references ("Pagliaccio Strategico", calcetto blunders)
- **Fantacalcio Woes**: Specific lineup disasters and bad luck stories
- **General Serie A**: Standard trivia mixed with group-specific context

**Question Structure**:
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  type: 'prediction-fail' | 'controversial-statement' | 'referee-conspiracy' | 
        'player-debate' | 'inside-joke' | 'fantacalcio' | 'general',

## Specific Content Implementation Examples

### Sample Questions Based on Chat Analysis

**Prediction Fail Questions**:
- "Who confidently predicted Atalanta would beat Milan 4-0 in December, only to be proven spectacularly wrong?"
- "Which Inter fan predicted their team would beat Milan in the Supercoppa?"
- "According to the chat, who was certain about a match outcome that went completely the opposite way?"

**Controversial Statement Questions**:
- "Which Inter fan declared Dimarco 'God on earth' and the best player in the world in his position?"
- "Who compared Vlahovic to 'Sanabria level' despite his €90M valuation?"
- "Which Milan fan earned the nickname 'Pagliaccio Strategico' for their defensive arguments?"

**Referee Conspiracy Questions**:
- "According to Sem, what THREE things were allegedly wrong with Inter's opening goal vs Atalanta?"
- "Which group member most frequently uses the term 'Marotta League' to describe Serie A officiating?"
- "What controversial VAR decision sparked the biggest referee debate in the chat?"

**Player Debate Questions**:
- "Who consistently defends Leão despite group criticism about his effort and attitude?"
- "Which player does the group universally mock, with one member saying 'wouldn't play for Verona'?" (Answer: Emerson Royal)
- "Who predicted Camarda would follow Sebastiano Esposito's trajectory?"

**Inside Joke Questions**:
- "What does 'Pagliaccio Strategico' translate to in English?"
- "Which calcetto moment involving a missed open goal became legendary group banter?"

**Fantacalcio Disaster Questions**:
- "Who benched Falcone the week he saved a penalty?"
- "Which player did someone bench, forgetting about a swap deal, who then performed well?"

### Banter Level Calibration

**Mild Banter** (Safe for all):
- General prediction mistakes
- Common player opinion differences
- Light fantacalcio complaints

**Spicy Banter** (Group-specific humor):
- Nickname usage and origins
- Specific controversial statements
- Calcetto performance jokes

**Savage Banter** (Maximum roast mode):
- Most embarrassing wrong predictions
- Hyperbolic statements proven wrong
- Personal performance disasters (calcetto, fantacalcio)

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All chat processing happens client-side
- No chat data transmitted to servers
- Option to clear all data after gameplay
- Anonymization of chat participants in questions (use nicknames)

### Content Filtering
- Remove sensitive personal information beyond football discussions
- Filter out genuinely mean-spirited content vs playful banter
- Ensure questions remain within established group humor boundaries
- Maintain the aggressive but friendly tone the group is comfortable with

## Deployment and Distribution

### Static Hosting
- Deploy as static website for easy access
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for app-like experience
- Custom domain for memorable access (e.g., juvlan.game)

### Sharing and Virality
